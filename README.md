The work discusses the SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) method for forecasting power generation using time series data. It explains that SARIMA is particularly effective for datasets with seasonality. The forecasting model uses parameters like date, time, and cloud cover as an external factor to improve accuracy. The input variables include the prediction date and cloud cover, while the output is the predicted power generation for that day. The work also details how ARIMA parameters were determined and highlights test results from a prediction test on 06.09.2020, demonstrating the modelâ€™s performance.
